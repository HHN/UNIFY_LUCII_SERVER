Heilbronn University is researching advanced technical tools and didactic approaches designed to foster collaboration and interaction. The primary goal is to enhance and facilitate interdisciplinary, inter-faculty, and inter-university cooperation. Through the InduKo research project, we aim to strengthen this collaboration using innovative digital tools and modern, digitally supported strategies that boost motivation and foster innovation through partnership.

Academic institutions are full of untapped collaboration potential. Researchers, faculty, students, alumni, and industry partners often have complementary interests but struggle to find the right connections. Lucii helps bridge this gap by enabling targeted networking, whether for research projects, study groups, mentoring, or industry collaboration. Lucii is a specialized matching solution designed to connect individuals in academic environments based on shared interests, expertise, and collaboration potential. Built on the Matrix messaging protocol and powered by AI on Edge, Lucii enables privacy-preserving matchmaking and initial anonymous contact without requiring a centralized database or external data processing. All profile evaluations and interest matching take place locally on the userâ€™s device, ensuring that no sensitive profile information is stored on central servers.

Lucii showcases how AI on Edge and the Matrix protocol can bring together the right people in a privacy-preserving way. By combining decentralized messaging with local AI-based matchmaking, Lucii demonstrates how meaningful academic connections can be established without the need for central processing and storage of highly personal profile information.
